# Welcome to the AI Assistant Jarvis module!

This has become somewhat of a passion project of mine where you can "speak" with your own personal AI assistant (Courtesy of OpenAI's Assistant API) and get help with anything you would like.

For the sake of this project, I wanted my Jarvis to help me with Mechanical, Electrical, and Computer Engineering to help fill gaps in my knowledge on projects I would like to work on.

## Current Features:
Jarvis has the current functionality:
1. You can speak to your assistant with your systems default microphone.
2. Your speech will be transcribed into text that can be fed to the API
3. Jarvis (once prompted and the prompt is complete) will speak back to you with to you with your information*
4. You and your assistant can communicate back and forth

## Planned Features:
1. Improved speaking back and forth
2. Function calling for browsing the web
3. Feed your own PDFs into the API for your own tailor made training
4. E-mailing transcripts of your conversations when you end the session
5. More to come

## Setup:
you will need a system variable called "OPENAI_API_KEY" with your own OpenAI Api key as the value in order for Jarvis to pick up the information.
